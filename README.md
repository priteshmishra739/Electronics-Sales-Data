Sales Analysis Project

Overview
Welcome to the Sales Analysis project! This project involves the analysis of sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset includes information about products, quantities ordered, prices, order dates, and purchase addresses. We aim to gain insights into sales trends, product popularity, and customer behavior.

Project Structure
- **Data:** Contains raw and processed sales data.
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks featuring code for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
- **Results:** Output files, visualizations, and key findings.
- **Docs:** Additional documentation or resources related to the project.

the project steps in a brief format:
1. Data Collection:
   - Merged monthly sales data into a consolidated CSV file.
   - Read the consolidated data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Removed rows with missing values.
   - Eliminated unnecessary text in the 'Order Date' column.
   - Converted relevant columns to the appropriate data types.

3. Data Augmentation:
   - Added columns for month, an alternative month method, and city based on the purchase address.

4. Data Exploration:
   - Explored various aspects, including monthly sales, city-wise sales, and optimal advertisement timing.

5. Visualizations:
   - Used Matplotlib for visualizing sales trends, city-wise sales, and other key insights.

6. Insights and Analysis:
   - Identified patterns such as peak sales months, popular products, and city-wise sales distribution.

7. Documentation:
   - Documented the analysis process, code, and key findings in Jupyter Notebooks.

8. Code Quality:
   - Ensured code readability with clear variable names, functions, and comments.

9. Conclusions and Recommendations:
   - Drew conclusions based on data exploration and provided actionable recommendations.

Insights
1. Monthly Sales:
   - Identify the best month for sales and visualize the sales trend.
2. City-wise Sales:
   - Explore which city sold the most products and visualize the sales distribution.
3. Optimal Advertisement Timing:
   - Determine the best time to display advertisements for maximizing sales.
4. Products Sold Together:
   - Identify products that are often sold together using a combination of data manipulation and visualization.
5. Top-selling Products:
   - Explore which products sold the most and visualize the quantity ordered and their average prices.

Results and Visualizations
The analysis results are presented through visualizations, and key insights are discussed in the Jupyter Notebooks. Feel free to explore and gain a deeper understanding of the sales patterns.
