Sales Analysis Project

Overview
Welcome to the Sales Analysis project! This project involves the analysis of sales data using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset includes information about products, quantities ordered, prices, order dates, and purchase addresses. We aim to gain insights into sales trends, product popularity, and customer behavior.

Project Structure
Data: Contains raw and processed sales data.
Notebooks: Jupyter Notebooks featuring code for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
Results: Output files, visualizations, and key findings.
Docs: Additional documentation or resources related to the project.
Data Cleaning
The project begins with merging data from monthly CSV files, cleaning NaN values, and converting columns to the correct data types. Text in the order date column is removed, and additional columns like month, city, hour, and minute are added for further analysis.

Data Exploration
1. Monthly Sales
Identify the best month for sales and visualize the sales trend.
2. City-wise Sales
Explore which city sold the most products and visualize the sales distribution.
3. Optimal Advertisement Timing
Determine the best time to display advertisements for maximizing sales.
4. Products Sold Together
Identify products that are often sold together using a combination of data manipulation and visualization.
5. Top-selling Products
Explore which products sold the most and visualize the quantity ordered and their average prices.
Results and Visualizations
The analysis results are presented through visualizations and key insights are discussed in the Jupyter Notebooks. Feel free to explore and gain a deeper understanding of the sales patterns.
